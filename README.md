# LeNet_based_architecture

### Goal: Try to construct a more complex network based on LeNet to improve its accuracy. 

- Adjusting the convolution widow size.
- Adjusting the number of ouput channels.
- Adjusting the activation function.
- Adjusting the number of convolution layers.
- Adjusting the number of fully connected layers.
- Adjusting the learning rates and other training details.
